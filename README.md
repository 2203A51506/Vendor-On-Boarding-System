# Vendor Onboarding & Delivery Management System

# Project Overview
This project is a web-based application that digitizes vendor registration, verification, approval,
order assignment, and delivery tracking. It replaces manual paperwork and spreadsheets with a
secure, centralized and automated system using Frontend technologies, Django and MySQL.

# Problem Statement
Many organizations still use paper forms, emails and Excel sheets to manage vendors. This causes
delays, data loss, poor tracking, and compliance risks. There is no proper system to verify
documents, track approvals, monitor deliveries, or evaluate vendor performance. A centralized,
secure and automated solution is required.
